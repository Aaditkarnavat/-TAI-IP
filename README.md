# Stock Price Predictor

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning approach to stock price prediction using historical closing prices.

## Overview
The model uses the previous day's closing price to predict the next day's price using a linear regression model.  
The goal of this project is to showcase a clean end-to-end ML workflow rather than provide financial advice.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess historical stock price data
2. Create lag-based features
3. Train a regression model
4. Evaluate predictions using mean squared error
5. Visualize actual vs predicted prices
